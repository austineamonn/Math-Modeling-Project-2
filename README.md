# Math-Modeling-Project-2
For MAT 306
Commands to type to run the calculations/graphs:


integrated()
* This runs all the calculations in the analysis, such as maximum growth rate, maximum population, maximum revenue, sensitivities, etc. 

 graph_integrated()
* This runs the graphs included in the anlysis

whale_pop_model.m
* Edit what "type" on line 19 is equal to in order to obtain graphs showing population levels over time, with varying hunting rates that stay the same over time. For example, the graph of "type=1" gives the populations over time in a world where whalers are killing the whales at exactly the initial growth rate. "Type=1.20" gives the populations over time in a world where whalers are killing the whales at 20% more than the initial growth rate. "Type=0.80" gives the populations over time in a world where whalers are killing the whales at 20% less than the initial growth rate.
